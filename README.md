# PTV Data Processor

Crunching numbers with data supplied by Public Transport Victoria.

In order to run this project, you will need the PTV passenger count dataset. You can download it from the [PTV website](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/train-service-passenger-counts/resource/162887ef-1dba-4d9b-83bd-baee229229c6).

Place the dataset in the root directory. Keep in mind that it's a 2 gigabyte file.
